# 🚗 Car Number Plate Extraction Pipeline

A complete **end-to-end number plate recognition system** built using classical computer vision techniques, inspired by:

📘 *"Car Number Plate Extraction in Three Steps.pdf"*

---

## ✨ Features

✔️ Real-time number plate detection  
✔️ Perspective correction (alignment)  
✔️ OCR-based text extraction (Tesseract)  
✔️ Format validation (Rwandan plates 🇷🇼)  
✔️ Temporal smoothing for accuracy  
✔️ Automatic logging to CSV  
✔️ Duplicate suppression  

---

## 🧠 Pipeline Overview

The system processes input frames through the following stages:

### 🔍 1. Detection (`detect.py`)
- Convert image to grayscale  
- Apply Gaussian blur  
- Perform Canny edge detection  
- Detect contours  
- Filter by:
  - Area
  - Aspect ratio  

---

### 🧭 2. Alignment (`align.py`)
- Applies **perspective transformation**
- Converts detected plate into a clean rectangular view  
- Improves OCR accuracy  

---

### 🔤 3. OCR (`ocr.py`)
- Uses **Tesseract OCR**
- Optimized for:
  - Single-line text
  - Character whitelisting  

---

### ✅ 4. Validation (`validate.py`)
- Uses regex to validate Rwandan plates:

```regex
[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{3}[A-Z]

✔️ Example: RAB123C


🔁 5. Temporal Smoothing (temporal.py)

Maintains a buffer of detected plates

Uses majority voting to improve reliability

💾 6. Logging (temporal.py)

Saves results to:

data/plates.csv

Includes:

->Plate number

->Timestamp

->Prevents duplicate entries
